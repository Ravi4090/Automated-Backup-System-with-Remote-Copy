# Automated Backup System with Remote Copy

The Automated Backup System with Remote Copy is a shell scripting project designed to automate the process of backing up critical data on a Linux system and securely transferring it to a remote server. This project enhances data protection, resilience, and disaster recovery preparedness by leveraging shell scripting, encryption, and remote file transfer protocols.

## Key Features

- **Incremental Backups:** Utilizes rsync to perform incremental backups, minimizing backup time and storage requirements by only transferring modified or new files.
  
- **Encryption:** Implements AES-256 encryption using OpenSSL to secure backup files, ensuring data confidentiality during storage and transmission.

- **Remote Copy:** Copies the encrypted backup files to a remote server using the `scp` command, providing offsite data redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities.

- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report backup failures, ensuring timely intervention and resolution.

- **Logging:** Logs backup activities and errors to a dedicated log file for monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes.

## Technologies Used

- Shell Scripting (Bash)
- rsync for incremental backups
- OpenSSL for encryption
- scp for remote file transfer

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-backup-system.git
```

2. Modify the configuration variables in the backup script (`backup.sh`) according to your requirements:

```bash
backup_dir="/path/to/backup/directory"
source_dir="/path/to/source/directory"
encryption_key="your_encryption_key"
remote_server="username@remote_server:/path/to/remote/backup/directory"
```

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

## Project Outcome

The Automated Backup System with Remote Copy provides a reliable and efficient solution for safeguarding critical data on Linux systems. By automating the backup process, implementing encryption, and facilitating remote copy functionality, the system enhances data protection, resilience, and disaster recovery preparedness.
